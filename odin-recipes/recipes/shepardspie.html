        <p>Easy shepherd's pie â€” the name says it all with this recipe. This dish is comforting and hearty with cream cheese added in for irresistible flavor, all in just a few simple steps.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 cups hot mashed potatoes</li>
            <li>4 ounces Philadelphia Cream Cheese, cubed</li>
            <li>1 cup Kraft Shredded Cheddar Cheese, divided</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>4 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed</li>
            <li>1 cup beef gravy</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Brown meat in a large skillet. While the meat is browning, mix potatoes, cream cheese, 1/2 cup shredded cheese, and garlic until well blended.</li>
            <li>Drain meat. Return to skillet; stir in vegetables and gravy. Spoon into a 9-inch square baking dish. Cover with potato mixture and remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p><strong>Recipe Tip:</strong> Use instant mashed potatoes. Prepare potatoes as directed on the package, omitting the milk. This way when you add the cream cheese the potatoes stay fluffy.</p>
